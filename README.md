### MOTIVATION
No one relishes having to pay taxes, but taxes are necessary to fund government services and activities.  If we must pay taxes, at the very least, let us ensure taxation is implemented fairly, accurately and transparently.  Transparency will help in both eliminating errors and preventing fraud.  With that in mind, I chose to analyze data from the Davidson County Property Assessor's Office which is used to calculate property taxes collected by Davidson County.  I explored the following:

- What anomalies, if any, exist in real property tax assessments in Davidson County?  What explains them?  What corrections are to be made?
- Beyond that, how can the data be presented and used in a way that property owners can trust their tax bill is fair and accurate?
- Can a tool be created to provide data transparency in an easier format for property owners to challenge their tax bill, if appropriate? 

### DATA
To answer these questions, I used property appraisal and assessment data provided by the Davidson County Property Assessor's Office.  Data was provided in a combination of Access database files, Excel workbooks and txt files which were cleaned and merged in Python.
